"""Select one night's slice of source files for the rotating mutation sweep.

Synced from portolan-sdi/portolan-ops (templates/repo/scripts/).
Edit it there. Local changes are overwritten on the next sync.

The full tree generates ~45k mutants, far more than one nightly window can test,
so each night mutates ``1/NUM_SHARDS`` of the files and the whole tree is covered
every ``NUM_SHARDS`` nights.

Files are assigned to a shard by a hash of their path, not by their index in the
sorted file list. Index assignment reshuffles every file's shard whenever a file
is added or removed, which makes a recorded per-shard kill rate
(``.mutation-shards.json``) meaningless the moment the tree changes. Hashing
moves only the added or removed file.

Assignment is BLAKE2b of the path under the package directory, modulo the shard
count: stable across runs, machines, and Python versions (unlike ``hash()``,
which is salted per process). A cryptographic digest rather than CRC-32 because
these paths share long prefixes — ``pkg/extract/...`` — and CRC-32's
weak avalanche clustered them, leaving one shard with 17 files and another with
1. The key drops everything above the package, so where the checkout lives
cannot change which shard a file belongs to.

Paths are printed relative to the package for the same reason: they feed
``scripts/mutant_globs.py``, which dots a path into a module name, and an
absolute path would dot the filesystem prefix into a glob matching no mutant.

Usage:
    python scripts/shard_select.py --root src --num-shards 25 --shard 8

Exit codes: 0 = selected paths written to stdout, one per line; 1 = nothing to
mutate, whether the root holds no Python files (a broken checkout) or none of
them hashed into this shard. Neither is a covered sweep, so neither exits 0.
